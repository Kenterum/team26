          <p class="paragraph"><strong> About Me:</strong> Hey, am Murad Guliyev.  In 2003 I was born and live in Baku.  Studied at the Baku Avropean Lyceum.  During my school years, my favorite subject was mathematics.  I went to Olympiads in Mathematics and Informatics, took 2nd place in the State Olympiad in Informatics, several times performed with a project at the Baku Expo Center in front of the ministers of education of Azerbaijan.  Since my school days, I have been fond of robotics and participated in fll, where our team won first place and we represented our country in Estonia.  After that I was elected as the jury of the Olympiad in Baku.  I am currently studying at Ada at the Faculty of Information Technology and working as a robotics teacher at Azerobot.  I really like everything related to numbers, technology and innovation.  Therefore, I chose this faculty for myself and I hope to graduate from the university with high results and enroll in a master abroad.  After graduation, I want to become a business analyst and develop in this business.</p>

          <p class="paragraph">This website is created by our team members. It's an assignment from our beloved teacher Dr. Araz Yusubov to develop our awareness on how to devolve a website. In the beginning, all of our team members didn't have any related course to it. Our team members with the help of our group leader we came to an idea of how to develop it. We planned it for two consecutive days and we started.  It took a little long time. Finally, we use our knowledge from the code.org project and also use some reference books and YouTube videos. In the end, we made it.</p>
