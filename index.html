During my school years, my favorite subject was mathematics.  I went to Olympiads in Mathematics and Informatics, took 2nd place in the State Olympiad in Informatics, several times performed with a project at the Baku Expo Center in front of the ministers of education of Azerbaijan.  Since my school days, I have been fond of robotics and participated in fll, where our team won first place and we represented our country in Estonia.  After that I was elected as the jury of the Olympiad in Baku.  I am currently studying at Ada at the Faculty of Information Technology and working as a robotics teacher at Azerobot.  I really like everything related to numbers, technology and innovation.  Therefore, I chose this faculty for myself and I hope to graduate from the university with high results and enroll in a master abroad.  After graduation, I want to become a business analyst and develop in this business.</p>

          <p class="paragraph">This website is created by our team members. It’s an assignment from our beloved teacher Dr. Araz Yusubov to develop our awareness on how to devolve a website. In the beginning, all of our team members decided to start with the courses in Codecademy. Our team members with the help of our group leader we came to an idea of how to develop it. We planned it for two consecutive days and we started.  It took a little long time. Finally, we use our knowledge from Codecademy  and also used some reference books and YouTube videos. At the end, we made it.</p>

        <p class="paragraph hour-of-code-p">To guarantee that our pupils have a successful day, we planned ahead of time:
1.Read through the educator's guide for Hour of Code.
2. Using Hour of Code to register our event. Every school that registers receives acknowledgement, and registration allows Code.org to track effect.
3.Choosing 2–3 activities/tutorials for the full week and putting them to the test initially. This stage prepared us for assisting students in making connections to past classes, understanding how to encourage learning, and anticipating where some of them could get stuck, in our opinion.
4.Adapted any of Code.org's classes or activities to our class's needs.
We're attempting to convince kids that the Hour of Code may be the beginning of their coding and programming adventure, and that they should concentrate on some of the core ideas that are essential to coding in any programming language. We will teach pupils the fundamentals of input, output, loops, and functions.</p>
